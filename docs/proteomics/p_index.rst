* `BioMS <https://bioms.se/>`_ Swedish National Infrastructure for Biological 
  Mass Spectrometry national infrastructure enables cutting-edge mass spectrometry 
  and related advanced technology platforms to be part of your research projects.
* `Chemical proteomics & proteogenomics <https://www.scilifelab.se/facilities/chemical-proteomics-proteogenomics>`_ 
  national facility offers state-of-the art mass spectrometry (MS)-based 
  proteomics support, including experimental planning, MS analysis and data 
  analysis related to proteogenomics and chemical proteomics.

`ProteomeXchange <http://www.proteomexchange.org/>`_ Consortium provide globally 
coordinated standard data submission and dissemination pipelines involving the 
main proteomics repositories: 

* `PRIDE <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/>`_ - admits protein and peptide 
  identification/quantification data with the accompanying mass spectra 
  evidence and any other related data types. Submission is done using the 
  `PX Submission Tool <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/markdownpage/pridesubmissiontool>`_, 
  see `tutorial <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/static/markdown/submitdatapage/files/Submission_Tutorial.pdf>`_.

* `PeptideAtlas <http://www.peptideatlas.org/>`_ - for SRM/MRM data that does 
  not fit into PRIDE (targeted datasets). Submission is done via 
  `PASSEL <http://www.peptideatlas.org/passel/>`_.

If you have data that requires controlled access because of personal privacy 
issues, informed consents, and/or ethical approvals etc, we suggest to store 
the data locally in a secure environment and make a metadata-only record in 
the `SciLifeLab Data Repository <https://www.scilifelab.se/community-pages/systems-data/repository/>`_ 
with contact details on how to get access, and for which a DOI (ie a persistent 
identifier) can be issued. The DOI can then be used in the article to refer to 
the dataset.
