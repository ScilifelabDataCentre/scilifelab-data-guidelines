  Welcome to SciLifeLab Data Guidelines!
########################################
`SciLifeLab <https://scilifelab.se>`_ is committed to the principles of 
:doc:`FAIR <./general/fair_principles>` (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable 
and Reusable) research data, i.e. that data should be easily accessed, 
understood, exchanged and reused. We work actively to ensure that the 
investments done by the society in research infrastructure resources 
can achieve the highest possible impact.

Research data management concerns the organization, storage, preservation, 
and sharing of data that is collected or analysed during a research project. 
Proper planning and management of research data will make project management 
easier and more efficient while projects are being performed. It also 
facilitates sharing and allows others to validate as well as reuse the data.
 
The purpose of these guidelines is to serve as an information 
resource to researchers regarding research data management. 
Click on any of the data types for guidance on good data
management practices during the data life cycle, including 
available infrastructures for data generation and analysis 
and appropriate data repositories for sharing. There is 
also overarching guidance, applicable to all data types, on e.g. metadata 
standards and managing sensitive data under General information.
