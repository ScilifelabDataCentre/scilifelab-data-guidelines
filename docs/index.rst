########################################
  Welcome to SciLifeLab Data Guidelines!
########################################

The purpose of these guidelines is to serve as an information 
resource to researchers regarding research data management. Proper
data management, introduced already when planning a project design, 
ensures that the data remains safe and in a good condition through 
the whole project and beyond.
 
Click on any of the data types for guidance on good data
management practices during the data life cycle, including 
available infrastructures and appropriate repositories. There is 
also overarching guidance, regardless of data type, on e.g. metadata 
standards and managing sensitive data under General information.
