# Data life cycle
The data life cycle is typically divided into design, generation, analysis, storage & archiving, and sharing. Below you will find information about infrastructure resources available during these phases. ![Data life cycle](/docs/images/data_life_cycle_circle_logos.png)

## Data design
During this phase you plan for wich data is needed to answer your research question. High quality science is often only possible if the resource facilities you intend to use gets involved already in the planning phase of a project. Consultation and advice regarding data management planning, data generation and data analysis are offered by [NBIS](https://nbis.se/) and [SciLifeLab](https://www.scilifelab.se/). 

Also, some resources have specific application periods and thus needs to be contacted well in advance. If your project includes sensitive human data, remember to apply for an ethics approval and report the data processing to your [Data protection officer](/docs/general/data_protection_officer).

## Data generation
SciLifeLab offers a wide range of data generation [services](https://www.scilifelab.se/infrastructure/) depending on which types of data is to be produced during the project.

## Data analysis

### Computational resources
[SNIC](https://www.snic.se/ "SNIC homeage") (Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing) is a national research infrastructure that makes available large scale high performance computing resources, storage capacity, and advanced user support, for Swedish researchers. [Apply](https://www.snic.se/allocations/compute/ "SNIC compute") for Small, Medium, Large or Sensitive data allocation, depending on size and type of project.

### Standard analyses
... *have not even an idea what to put here, do we mean the standard pipelines NGI eg offers?* 

### Project-specific analyses
Bioinformatic support is offered by [NBIS](https://nbis.se/support/ "NBIS support").

## Data storage and archiving
... *Intro about responsbilities regarding archiving and storage; what is the responsibilities, do we have links?*

[SNIC](https://www.snic.se/allocations/storage/ "SNIC storage") offers storage for small and medium-sized datasets. In the future also large-sized storage will be offered.

*University/Institutional repositories?*

## Data sharing
In the era of [FAIR](https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples) (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) and [Open science](https://www.vr.se/english/mandates/open-science/open-access-to-research-data.html), datasets should be made available to the public. There are domain-specific repositories, see e.g. [ELIXIR Core resources](https://elixir-europe.org/platforms/data/core-data-resources), as well as general repositories such as [Figshare](https://figshare.com/) and [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/).
