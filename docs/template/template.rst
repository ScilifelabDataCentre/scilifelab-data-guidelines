If you have data that requires controlled access because of personal privacy 
issues, informed consents, and/or ethical approvals etc, we suggest to store 
the data locally in a secure environment and make a metadata-only record in 
the `SciLifeLab Data Repository <https://www.scilifelab.se/community-pages/systems-data/repository/>`_ 
with contact details on how to get access, and for which a DOI (ie a persistent 
identifier) can be issued. The DOI can then be used in the article to refer to 
the dataset.
