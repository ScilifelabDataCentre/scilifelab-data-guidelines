The data life cycle is typically divided into design, generation, analysis, storage 
& archiving, and sharing. Below you will find information about infrastructure 
resources available during these phases.

Data design
============
During this phase you plan for wich data is needed to answer your research question. 
High quality science is often only possible if the resource facilities you intend 
to use gets involved already in the planning phase of a project. Consultation and 
advice regarding data management planning, data generation and data analysis are 
offered by `NBIS <https://nbis.se>`_ and `SciLifeLab <https://scilifelab.se>`_. 

It is wise to write a data management plan, using either a tool provided by your 
university or `DS wizard <http://dsw.scilifelab.se/>`_.

Also, some resources have specific application periods and thus needs to be 
contacted well in advance. If your project includes sensitive human data, note 
that there are ethical and legal issues that you have to consider, such as 
apply for an ethics approval and report the data processing to your 
:doc:`Data Protection Officer </docs/general/data_protection_officer>`. See the page on 
:doc:`Sensitive data </docs/general/sensitive_data>` for more information.
