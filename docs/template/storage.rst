Data storage and archiving
==========================
After the project is finished, the data needs to be stored in a backed-up fashion 
at least for 10 years, and for as long as the data is of scientific value. After 
this time, some of the data should be archived and some can be disposed. It is 
best to contact your :doc:`university </docs/general/research_data_office>` for 
information about the procedures for this. 

`SNIC <https://www.snic.se/allocations/storage/>`_ offers storage for small and 
medium-sized datasets. In the future also large-sized storage will be offered.
