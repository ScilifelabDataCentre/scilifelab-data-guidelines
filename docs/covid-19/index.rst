General information
###################
Please see the `Swedish COVID-19 Data Portal <https://www.covid19dataportal.se/>`_ 
for the latest information regarding Swedish efforts in COVID-19 research. 
Also see the `European COVID-19 Data Portal <https://www.covid19dataportal.org/>`_
for useful information.

Data management plan
####################
It is wise to write a data management plan, using either a tool provided by your 
university or 'DS wizard http://dsw.scilifelab.se/'.

Project-specific analysis
#########################
'NBIS https://nbis.se/support/ "NBIS support"' (National Bioinformatics 
Infrastructure Sweden) is a national research infrastructure that offers 
bioinformatic support in various forms for a wide range of areas including 
NGS, proteomics, metabolomics and biostatistics.

Computational resources
#######################
'SNIC https://www.snic.se/' (Swedish National Infrastructure 
for Computing) is a national research infrastructure that makes available 
large scale high performance computing resources. 
'Apply https://www.snic.se/allocations/compute/' 
for Small, Medium, Large or Sensitive data allocation, depending on 
size and type of project.

Guidelines about repositories, data formats and metadata standards
##################################################################
The guidelines in all sections regarding COVID-19 has been adapted from the 
'['Research Data Alliance https://rd-alliance.org/' 3rd release of the 
'COVID-19 Data Sharing Recommendations & Guidelines https://www.rd-alliance.org/system/files/RDA%20COVID-19%3B%20recommendations%20and%20guidelines%2C%203rd%20release%208%20May%202020.pdf'

General guidelines
******************
* Think early about systematic naming of filenames. Not thinking about it early enough is often the cause of a lot of extra work when the data is not stored in a database and researchers have to rename a large number of files manually at a later stage.
* Document the computing time and resources required for data processing. This could help other researchers to assess the time and resources required for the pipeline, therefore to decide whether it is feasible to proceed with the local resources available.
* When selecting a repository for submission of the data, priority should be given to domain-specific repositories over generic (e.g. institutional) repositories. Domain-specific repositories are easier to find, and often have better visualization and selection facilities for re-users of the data.
* The repositories listed for deposition are also prime locations for locating existing data. Many now have dedicated sections for new as well as pre-existing data relevant to Covid19 research. 

The following sections contain guidelines adressing specific covid-19 data 
types and resources:
