### Facilities in SciLifeLab providing services within this field:

#### Data generation

* [NGI](https://ngisweden.scilifelab.se/)

#### Data analysis

* [NBIS](https://nbis.se)

### Repositories

#### [ENA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena)

The ENA hosts an instance of the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), the same archive that exists on NCBI. SRA accepts raw sequence data from any sequencing platform, generated in any research project.  

##### Submission

There are several ways to [submit](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit) data to ENA, including extensive documentation on [programmatic submissions](https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/programmatic.html).
