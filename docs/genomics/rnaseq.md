### Facilities in SciLifeLab providing services within this field:

#### Data generation

* [NGI](https://ngisweden.scilifelab.se/)

#### Data analysis

* [NBIS](https://nbis.se)


### Repositories

For RNAseq datatypes these repositories are relevant:

* SRA for raw read data
* ArrayExpress for experiment descriptions and processed expression data


#### SRA

The Sequence Read Archive (SRA) is part of the European Nucleotide Archive ([ENA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena)) and accepts data from all sequencing platforms for all applications of sequencing in research.  

#### ArrayExpress

ArrayExpress is another part of [ENA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena), similar to NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus database and can be used to archive experimental designs and analysis files based on the raw sequence reads.
