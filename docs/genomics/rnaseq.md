### Facilities in SciLifeLab providing services within this field:

#### Data generation

* [NGI](https://ngisweden.scilifelab.se/)

#### Data analysis

* [NBIS](https://nbis.se)

### Repositories

For RNA-seq datatypes these repositories are relevant:

* SRA for raw read data
* ArrayExpress for experiment descriptions and processed expression data

#### SRA

The Sequence Read Archive (SRA) is part of the European Nucleotide Archive ([ENA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena)). SRA accepts raw sequence data from any sequencing platform, generated in any research project.  

##### Submission

There are several ways to [submit](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit) data to ENA, including extensive documentation on [programmatic submissions](https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/programmatic.html).

#### [ArrayExpress](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/)

ArrayExpress is another part of [ENA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena), similar to NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus database and can be used to archive experimental designs and analysis files based on the raw sequence reads. 

##### Submission

ArrayExpress has its own [submission portal](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/submit/overview.html) where information is available on what can be submitted and how.
