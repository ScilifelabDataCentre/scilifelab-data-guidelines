### Facilities in SciLifeLab providing services within this field:

#### Data generation

* [NGI](https://ngisweden.scilifelab.se/)

#### Data analysis

* [NBIS](https://nbis.se)

### Repositories

For RNA-seq data types these repositories are relevant:

* European Nucleotide Archive ([ENA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena)) for raw read data
* ArrayExpress for experiment descriptions and processed expression data

These repositories are both European ELIXIR Core Data Resources. Samples are linked between databases to make sure each part of the dataset is findable. Submitted data can be kept private until the associated research article is published. 

#### [ENA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena)

The ENA hosts an instance of the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), the same archive that exists on NCBI. SRA accepts raw sequence data from any sequencing platform, generated in any research project.  

##### Submission

There are several ways to [submit](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit) data to ENA, including extensive documentation on [programmatic submissions](https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/programmatic.html).

#### [ArrayExpress](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/)

ArrayExpress is tighty integrated with [ENA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena) and similar to NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus database it can be used to archive experimental designs and analysis files based on the raw sequence reads. 

##### Submission

ArrayExpress has its own [submission portal](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/submit/overview.html) where information is available on what can be submitted and how.
