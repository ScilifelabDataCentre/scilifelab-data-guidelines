# Whole-genome sequencing (human)

The data life cycle is typically divided into design, generation, analysis, storage & archiving, and sharing. Below you will find information about infrastructure resources available during these phases.

## Data design
During this phase you plan for wich data is needed to answer your research question. High quality science is often only possible if the resource facilities you intend to use gets involved already in the planning phase of a project. Consultation and advice regarding data management planning, data generation and data analysis are offered by [NBIS](https://nbis.se/) and [SciLifeLab](https://www.scilifelab.se/). 

It is wise to write a data management plan, using either a tool provided by your university or [DS wizard](http://dsw.scilifelab.se/).

Also, some resources have specific application periods and thus needs to be contacted well in advance. If your project includes sensitive human data, note that there are ethical and legal issues that you have to consider, such as apply for an ethics approval and report the data processing to your [Data protection officer](/docs/general/data_protection_officer). See the page on [Sensitive personal data](/docs/general/sensitive_data) for more information.

## Data generation
Facilities which offer data generation services for whole-genome sequencing:

* [NGI](https://ngisweden.scilifelab.se/) (National Genomics Infrastructure) offers an infrastructure equipped with a comprehensive range of technology platforms for next generation sequencing (NGS) and genotyping.

## Data analysis
Facilities which offer data analysis services for whole-genome sequencing:

* [NBIS](https://nbis.se/support/ "NBIS support") (National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden) national research infrastructure offers bioinformatic support in various forms for a wide range of areas including NGS, proteomics, metabolomics and biostatistics.

### Computational resources:
[SNIC](https://www.snic.se/ "SNIC homepage") (Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing) national research infrastructure makes available large scale high performance computing resources. [Apply](https://www.snic.se/allocations/compute/ "SNIC compute") for Small, Medium, Large or Sensitive data allocation, depending on size and type of project.

## Data storage and archiving
After the project is finished, the data needs to be stored in a backed-up fashion at least for 10 years, and for as long as the data is of scientific value. After this time, some of the data should be archived and some can be disposed. It is best to contact your [university](/docs/general/research_data_office) for information about the procedures for this. 

## Data sharing
In the era of [FAIR](/docs/general/fair_principles) (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) and [Open science](https://www.vr.se/english/mandates/open-science/open-access-to-research-data.html), datasets should be made available to the public. 

### Repositories for whole-genome sequencing data
NBIS is building a local federated version of the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) in Sweden (EGA-SE), allowing for the publication of sensitive personal data within a legal framework. Until local EGA is available, the dataset should remain in the secure analysis environment (eg at Bianca on Uppmax). We suggest to make a metadata-only record in the [SciLifeLab Data Repository](https://www.scilifelab.se/community-pages/systems-data/repository/) with contact details on how to get access, and for which a DOI (ie a persistent identifier) can be issued. The DOI can then be used in the article to refer to the dataset. Once the Swedish EGA is operational, and the dataset deposited there, the access information can be changed to point at the EGA ID. See [https://doi.org/10.17044/NBIS/G000014](https://doi.org/10.17044/NBIS/G000014), for an example.

### Metadata
