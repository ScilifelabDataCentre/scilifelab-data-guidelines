Data sharing
=============
In the era of `FAIR </docs/general/fair_principles>`_ (Findable, Accessible, 
Interoperable and Reusable) and `Open science 
<https://www.vr.se/english/mandates/open-science/open-access-to-research-data.html>`_, 
datasets should be made available to the public. 

Repositories for Whole-genome sequencing data (human)
**************************************************************
NBIS is building a local federated version of the European Genome-phenome 
Archive (EGA) in Sweden (EGA-SE), allowing for the publication of sensitive 
personal data within a legal framework. Until local EGA is available, the 
dataset should remain in the secure analysis environment (eg at Bianca on 
Uppmax). We suggest to make a metadata-only record in the `SciLifeLab Data 
Repository <https://www.scilifelab.se/community-pages/systems-data/repository/>`_ 
with contact details on how to get access, and for which a DOI (ie a 
persistent identifier) can be issued. The DOI can then be used in the article 
to refer to the dataset. Once the Swedish EGA is operational, and the dataset 
deposited there, the access information can be changed to point at the EGA ID. 
See `https://doi.org/10.17044/NBIS/G000014 
<https://doi.org/10.17044/NBIS/G000014>`_, for an example.
