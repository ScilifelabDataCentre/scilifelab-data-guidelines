* `BioMS <https://bioms.se/>`_ Swedish National Infrastructure for Biological 
  Mass Spectrometry national infrastructure enables cutting-edge mass spectrometry 
  and related advanced technology platforms to be part of your research projects.
* `Chemical proteomics & proteogenomics <https://www.scilifelab.se/facilities/chemical-proteomics-proteogenomics>`_ 
  national facility offers state-of-the art mass spectrometry (MS)-based 
  proteomics support, including experimental planning, MS analysis and data 
  analysis related to proteogenomics and chemical proteomics.

* `ALM <https://www.scilifelab.se/facilities/alm/>`_ Advanced Light Microscopy 
  facility give support with advanced fluorescence microscopy for nanoscale 
  biological visualization using SIM, STED, STORM/PALM superresolution imaging. 
  The facility also support single molecule spectroscopy measurement and 
  analysis with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), as well as combined 
  with superresolution dynamical studies (STED-FCS). Moreover, light-sheet 
  fluorescence microscopy support allow users to image live and/or optically 
  cleared larger samples. Submit your application at the NMI (National 
  Microscopy Infrastructure) `project portal <https://nmi.scilifelab.se/>`_.

* `Cryo-EM <https://cryoem.scilifelab.se/>`_ offers access to state-of-the-art 
  equipment and expertise in single particle cryo-EM and cryo-tomography (cryo-ET).


Data analysis
==============
Facilities which offer data analysis services for imaging:

* `BioImage Informatics Facility <https://www.scilifelab.se/facilities/bioimage-informatics/>`_ 
  provides support and education in image analysis in order to help users get 
  started with their own analysis.

Depending on the type of image data you have, different public repositories are 
available, please see the table at `BioImage Archive 
<https://www.ebi.ac.uk/bioimage-archive/>`_.

If you have data that requires controlled access because of personal privacy 
issues, informed consents, and/or ethical approvals etc, we suggest to store 
the data locally in a secure environment and make a metadata-only record in 
the `SciLifeLab Data Repository <https://www.scilifelab.se/community-pages/systems-data/repository/>`_ 
with contact details on how to get access, and for which a DOI (ie a persistent 
identifier) can be issued. The DOI can then be used in the article to refer to 
the dataset.
