General
========

The following sections contain general guidelines, independent of datatype. 
Metadata contains information about appropriate standards for (meta)data formats. 
If sensitive data is part of your project, we recommend reading the Sensitive data page. 
Also, there is a collection of Data protection officers (for sensitive data processing) 
and Research data offices (for data management guidance) at the different universities who can assist you further.
