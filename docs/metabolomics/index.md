# Metabolomics
The data life cycle is typically divided into design, generation, analysis, storage & archiving, and sharing. Below you will find information about infrastructure resources available during these phases.

## Data design
During this phase you plan for wich data is needed to answer your research question. High quality science is often only possible if the resource facilities you intend to use gets involved already in the planning phase of a project. Consultation and advice regarding data management planning, data generation and data analysis are offered by [NBIS](https://nbis.se/) and [SciLifeLab](https://www.scilifelab.se/). 

It is wise to write a data management plan, using either a tool provided by your university or [DS wizard](http://dsw.scilifelab.se/).

Also, some resources have specific application periods and thus needs to be contacted well in advance. If your project includes sensitive human data, note that there are ethical and legal issues that you have to consider, such as apply for an ethics approval and report the data processing to your [Data protection officer](/docs/general/data_protection_officer). See the page on [Sensitive personal data](/docs/general/sensitive_data) for more information.

## Data generation
Facilities which offer data generation services for metabolomics:

* [Swedish Metabolomics Centre (SMC)](http://www.swedishmetabolomicscentre.se/) specializes in analyzing metabolites and lipids with mass spectrometry based methods.

* [Swedish NMR Centre](https://www.scilifelab.se/facilities/swedish-nmr-centre/) provides access to state-of-the-art NMR instrumentation and methodology.

Consider to upload the raw data to a repository already when receiving them, under an embargo. This way you always have an off-site backup with the added benefit of making the [Data sharing](#data-sharing) phase more efficient.

## Data analysis
Facilities which offer data analysis services for metabolomics:
* [NBIS](https://nbis.se/support/ "NBIS support") (National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden) is a national research infrastructure that offers bioinformatic support in various forms for a wide range of areas including NGS, proteomics, metabolomics and biostatistics.

### Computational resources:
[SNIC](https://www.snic.se/ "SNIC homepage") (Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing) is a national research infrastructure that makes available large scale high performance computing resources. [Apply](https://www.snic.se/allocations/compute/ "SNIC compute") for Small, Medium, Large or Sensitive data allocation, depending on size and type of project.

## Data storage and archiving
After the project is finished, the data needs to be stored in a backed-up fashion at least for 10 years, and for as long as the data is of scientific value. After this time, some of the data should be archived and some can be disposed. It is best to contact your [university](/docs/general/research_data_office) for information about the procedures for this.  

[SNIC](https://www.snic.se/allocations/storage/ "SNIC storage") offers storage for small and medium-sized datasets. In the future also large-sized storage will be offered.

## Data sharing
In the era of [FAIR](https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples) (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) and [Open science](https://www.vr.se/english/mandates/open-science/open-access-to-research-data.html), datasets should be made available to the public. 

### Repositories for metabolomics data

<!-- [*enter name, links and general info about repository & submission here*]  -->
[MetaboLights](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/) is a database for Metabolomics experiments and derived information. The database is cross-species, cross-technique and covers metabolite structures and their reference spectra as well as their biological roles, locations and concentrations, and experimental data from metabolic experiments.

#### Other repositories
For other domain-specific repositories, see e.g. [ELIXIR Core resources](https://elixir-europe.org/platforms/data/core-data-resources), [EBI archive wizard](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/submission/) (help to find the right repository depending on data type), or [FAIRsharing](https://fairsharing.org/databases/) (the latter can also assist in finding metadata standards suitable for describing your datasets). For datasets that do not fit into domain-specifik repositories, there are general repositories such as [Figshare](https://figshare.com/) and [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/).
