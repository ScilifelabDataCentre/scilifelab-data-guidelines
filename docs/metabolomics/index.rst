`MetaboLights <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/>`_) is a database for 
Metabolomics experiments and derived information. The database is cross-species, 
cross-technique and covers metabolite structures and their reference spectra as 
well as their biological roles, locations and concentrations, and experimental 
data from metabolic experiments.

If you have data that requires controlled access because of personal privacy 
issues, informed consents, and/or ethical approvals etc, we suggest to store 
the data locally in a secure environment and make a metadata-only record in 
the `SciLifeLab Data Repository <https://www.scilifelab.se/community-pages/systems-data/repository/>`_ 
with contact details on how to get access, and for which a DOI (ie a persistent 
identifier) can be issued. The DOI can then be used in the article to refer to 
the dataset.
